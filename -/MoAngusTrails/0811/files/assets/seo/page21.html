Gary Fike then joined the tour at Ray’s Apple Market where the juniors toured the grocery store meat case display with Gary and gained some frst hand experience about CAB products and how they are marketed.  That afternoon the juniors toured Fink Beef Genetics at Randolph, KS and discussed with Galen and Lori Fink how the beef industry has evolved with the use of technology and how they have grown their operation.  The par-ticipants also toured the sale facility at Finks and discovered the importance of customer service in the Fink program. </span>

Kent and Nolan led a guided tour through the feedlot that highlighted some of their most recent expansions which have allowed them to be a leader in the feeding industry. </span>
      </p>

        <span class="">On Wednesday morning in the fnal leg of the academy the juniors visited the Sysco Food Service Distribution Center in Kansas City where they met with John Landry, Pre-mium Protein Brand Manager to learn about the Sysco Company and tour the facility.  The participants were given access to all segments of the warehouse and gained insight into the technology utilized in tracking inventory and deliveries.
