      <p>
        <span class="">In any business it’s important to have a clear picture of success — to defne it and how to achieve it. Naturally, we develop long-term goals and strategies for how to achieve them. While most businesses, including the American Angus Association, undergo periodic self-evaluations to set such plans, our most recent long-range planning efforts differ from anything we’ve ever done before. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Last fall, the American Angus Association and its Board of Di-rectors announced a long-range planning initiative to identify and as-sess the needs of our members, their customers and others with a stake in the U.S. Angus business. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">While it’s not the frst time we’ve undergone such an endeavor, it is the frst initiative in recent memory in which a breed association has put such effort into frst gathering input from those who have the biggest stake in its success — our members and their customers. The Association set to work on the preliminary process begin-ning in January 2011, when staff members and Board directors began conducting a series of long-range planning sessions, or listening ses-sions. Panelists of Angus breeder members, commercial cattlemen and feeders each weighed in on how our breed can remain relevant into the future. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">This valuable information was compiled in congruence with the more than 800 surveys submitted via mail and our website at www. angus.org, as well as individual input received by Board members. Your input was as interesting and insightful as it was valuable to the process. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Staff and the Board of Directors spent the last several months conducting long-range sessions with representatives of all industry sectors — and prioritizing the areas that will protect, and expand, the leadership position that we’ve worked so hard to secure. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">During our Board of Directors meeting earlier this summer, con-siderable discussion took place over the fnal drafting and dissemina-tion of the plan. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">In the coming months, you’ll be hearing more about the fnal Long Range Strategic Plan, which will be available this fall. Above all else, this has been a process that has allowed us to renew connections with not only those across the industry who are impacted by our decisions — but also with our members. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">It was good hearing from so many of you, and rewarding to see how many people care so deeply about where this organization is headed. With your continued help, this great breed of cattle will be successfully stewarded for the next generation. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Thanks to all who participated in the long range planning pro-cess. Your input played a critical role, and will continue to be the foundation of everything we do. </span>
