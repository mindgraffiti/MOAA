        <span class="">Proceeds from the sale of the heifer at the National Western Stock Show will beneft education, youth and research applicable to the Angus breed. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">TheAngus Foundation announced that Eddie and Connie Syden-stricker, owners of Sydenstricker Genetics of Mexico, Mo., will do-nate the 2012 Angus Foundation Heifer, set to sell in January 2012 at the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colo. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">SydGen Forever Lady 9525 is the special heifer chosen from the 78 fall-bred replacement heifers at Sydenstricker Genetics. She is the September 2009 daughter of SydGen 928 Destination 5420, who was co-owned with Spring Cove Ranch of Bliss, Idaho, and surfaced as perhaps the most popular son of 928. The female herself recorded the No. 1 weaning weight EPD, the No. 2 yearling weight EPD and the No. 1 $B index at the time of selection. She also posted the highest adjusted IMF scan of the entire heifer calf crop at 8.79 percent IMF to ratio 143. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Expected to calve in Sep-tember 2011, this heifer is bred to SydGen Dealer 9883, a son of SydGen Sure BET and ma-ternal brother to SydGen Trust 6228. He was the $14,000, second high-selling fall bull in Sydenstricker’s 2010 pro-duction sale to Big Dry Angus Ranch, Jordan, Mont.; Eggers Stock Farm, Jackson, Mo.; and the Mike Kasten Beef Alliance, Millersville, Mo. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Eddie and Connie Syden-stricker have been long-time supporters of the Angus Foun-dation, and it’s truly an honor for our organization to further merit their confdence, endorse-ment and support through their donation of this outstanding Angus female,” says Milford Jenkins, Angus Foundation </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">president. “Sydenstricker Genetics needs no introduction to Angus breeders, as its program has a well-proven and enviable track record of producing breed-leading seedstock genetics. This outstanding phenotypic and genotypic female was selected from the heart of the Sydenstricker’s powerful fall 2009 replacement females!” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Eddie Sydenstricker was the frst president of the frst state ju-nior Angus association ever formed, and he’s never forgotten his start — a start that’s encouraged him to give back to the breed. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“The Angus breed has been very good to Connie and me, and our daughters Kim and Lee Ann, and giving back through the Angus </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">Foundation ensures that strong tradition of outstanding youth and education programs,” Sydenstricker says. “2012 will mark our 60th year breeding Angus cattle, so this donation is a ftting way to kick off our diamond anniversary.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Ben Eggers, manager of Sydenstricker Genetics, says this elite heifer refects the production goals of the operation and offers a bal-anced package to auction in 2012. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“This female exemplifes our mission statement, combining soundness and fertility with growth, productivity and superior car-cass traits,” Eggers says. “To add to her value, she will be the very frst Foundation Heifer to sell with a calf already at-side.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The sale of the Angus Foundation Heifer Package, an annual fundraising tradition initiated in 1980, supports the Angus Founda-tion, the not-for-proft affliate of the American Angus Association </span>
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">that funds and supports programs involving education, youth and re-search in the Angus breed and agricultural industry. </span>
