        <span class="">WOOSTER, Ohio – July 22, 2011 – Although beef prices have been relatively high this spring and summer, many consumers and chefs are continuing to look for high-quality cuts. The </span>

        <span class=""> brand sold 70 million pounds in June, the highest volume month in the company’s 33-year history, 4.3% above the previous June and some 10 million pounds better than June 2009. This milestone, with three months to go, moves the company one step closer to a sixth consecutive fscal year of sales gains. “The real reason for this record goes beyond sales to the dedi-cation of our licensed partners,” says John Stika, company pres-ident. “They have committed to putting product in front of con-sumers even with high-priced beef, which further drives home the importance of quality in the price/value relationship. With strong cattle prices at the same time, pull-through demand is creating suc-cess at all levels.” </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">The share of Angus-infuenced cattle qualifying for the brand in June was 24.8%, nearly 4 percentage points higher than summer 2009. Sales gains came from foodservice, which has experienced signifcant recovery the past 12 to 18 months despite higher cattle and beef prices. Retail continues to carry the bulk of brand sales, with seasonally strong summer demand in full swing. The interna-tional division is setting a hot pace in rate of growth with a 17% increase over 2010 for the fscal year to date. </span>
