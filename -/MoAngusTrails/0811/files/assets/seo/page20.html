      <p>
        <span class="">By Wyatt Bechtel </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">A dry, favorless and thinly cut steak can be enough to sour any-one’s taste for beef. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“There is no doubt that cattle are getting bigger, and that will continue,” says Terry Houser, Kansas State University meat scientist. “I don’t think we are going to produce smaller rib-eyed cattle any-time soon or start selecting cattle for that trait.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Still, demand for beef looks bright, thanks to new cutting meth-ods developed to tackle the issue of increasing carcass size and its effect on the eating experience. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Some of these methods have been brought to market by the Beef Checkoff ’s Retail Marketing Team and its Beef Alternative Merchan-dising (BAM) program. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">BAM came about through “listening to what consumers want,” says Trevor Amen, channel marketing manager for the National Cat-tlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA), contractor for the Beef Check-off. “Through the years, the Retail Marketing Team’s cutting tests and focus groups put the product in front of consumers to really see how they interact and what their purchase interest would be.” According to Kari Underly, author of “The Art of Beef Cutting,” who worked with the team, consumers appreciate cooking tips and detailed recipes. They also prefer smaller cuts with less trim. “The right-size portion for many of them seems to be a 4-ounce (oz.) por-tion,” she says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">That might seem discouraging, considering the impetus was how to deal with larger carcass size, but it actually opens more doors in beef marketing, Underly says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">In research, new cuts were taken from the ribeye, strip and top butt of typical 700- to 800-pound (lb.) carcasses as well as those pushing the limits at 1,000 to 1,100 lb. </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We wanted to make sure BAM would work well fnancially on both sizes,” Underly explains. It did, and served to create a wider range of choices for consumers. “It’s an add-on to what retailers were already featuring.” </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">
          <strong>A top cut </strong>
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">The research dovetailed with efforts of the Beef Checkoff-fund-ed Beef Innovations Group (BIG). Prior to the concept of alternative cutting techniques, retailers had trouble marketing quality cuts from the top butt; now the trouble is simply keeping enough of it in the meat case. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“The top sirloin butt has certainly been a victory for us,” says Mark Gwin, CertifedAngus Beef LLC (CAB) research and develop-ment manager. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Also a member of BIG, Gwin says retail and consumer buy-in has been strongest for the alternative offerings from this wholesale cut, among all the middle meats. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Three retail cuts were developed through BIG: baseball steaks, culotte steaks and the flet of sirloin. “Any trimmed pieces can be used as medallions or fajita meat,” Gwin adds. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Top sirloins used to be cut exclusively into large steaks with no focus on the multiple muscle complexes within, creating tougher ar-eas within the cut when cooked, he says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The new cuts are thicker and pinpoint where the muscle grain changes. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We are giving people the means to cut these muscles into thick-er steaks to give them a more succulent experience,” Gwin says. Revise the ribeye </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“With the ribeye, we’re removing that cap muscle, the spinalis dorsi,” says Mark Polzer, CAB vice president of business development. </span>
