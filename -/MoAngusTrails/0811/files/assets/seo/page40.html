      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">We can explain marbling, but it takes frst-hand experience to believe in those little white fecks. We can promise favorful, juicy steaks, but words ring hollow when taste buds are required. And we can talk premiumAngus beef and quality standards all day long; con-sumers won’t listen unless they’re hungry for what we have. With that in mind, we took off for NewYork City on a fve-week “experiment” with the James Beard Foundation. Together we hosted a popup store and restaurant in the city’s trendy Chelsea Market. A popup business appears for a short time with specifc goals. In this case: education with a little “wow factor” thrown in.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">JBF LTD, as it was called, provided NewYorkers a limited oppor-tunity to eat, shop and learn about the CAB brand. But we didn’t just offer beef including CAB Prime tenderloins, T-bones, bone-in CAB Natural cowboy steaks and strip steaks. We also introduced consum-ers to a few of those “family ranchers” we’re always talking about. It was a combination of fabulous food and real people with real stories, and it made a meaningful impression on visitors. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">A “Cowboys and Cleavers” program brought Texas ranchers Steve and Ginger Olson together with renowned New York butcher Marc Sarrazin of DeBragga &amp; Spitler and CAB Chef Scott Popovic. They discussed the production process from ranch to plate. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">DeBragga was the frst distributor in New York to partner with the brand. “I love being able to put CAB product in front of chefs,” Sarrazin shared. “My customers know it’s a great product week in and week out. They have the opportunity to serve better than aver-age steaks and that’s the reason we work so hard selling it on a daily basis.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">On “Cowboy Fridays,” Angus seedstock producers came from </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">California, Montana, Oklahoma, New York and South Carolina to share their passion for raising cattle. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Noting that he’d heard beef called a “celebration food,” Dale-banks Angus Ranch owner Matt Perrier told JBF LTD visitors: “Our family loves to entertain, and if our cattle can offer a tremendous eating experience that entertains thousands of hungry people, we’ve done our job.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The Perriers raise cows and kids in the Kansas Flint Hills. Matt explained to JBF LTD customers that he treats his land and cattle like life depends on them. “And truly,” he admitted, “it does.”   </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The popup store gave us a chance to talk about the brand in a setting created with customers in mind.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">When they wondered, “Where is your beef served?” they heard and tasted meals from some of America’s best chefs, including Craig Deihl of Cypress restaurant in Charleston, S.C.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Deihl told folks he loves sourcing from local farmers, fsherman and premium purveyors like CAB. “It’s all about quality and consis-tency,” he said. “Without maintaining high standards in these areas, I’d be running just another restaurant.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">A guest exclaimed, “This is the best steak I’ve ever eaten!” and he meant it. His wife returned the following week to purchase more CAB cowboy steaks. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">JBF LTD gave us a unique and unexpected forum to showcase the CAB brand for consumers, celebrity chefs and </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Beginning today, the calving ease direct (CED) EPD joins AGI’s suite of genomic-enhanced selection tools generated using the Association’s extensive performance database and genomic re-sults now provided by both the High Density 50K (HD 50K) plat-form from Pfzer Animal Genetics and the Igenity</span>

      <p>
        <span class="">The calving ease direct EPD helps cattlemen predict the aver-age difference in ease with which a sire’s calves will be born when he is bred to frst-calf heifers. Expressed as a difference in percent-age of unassisted births, a higher value indicates greater calving ease in frst-calf heifers. </span>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">AGI offers genomic-enhanced EPDs for calving ease, carcass, growth (including birth, weaning and yearling weight EPDs; as well as milk) and residual average daily gain (RADG) traits incorporat-ing genomic data from both Pfzer Animal Genetics and Igenity. A genomic-enhanced EPD for docility incorporating Igenity results is also available. (Click here for a complete, regularly updated list of available genomic-enhanced EPDs.) </span>
