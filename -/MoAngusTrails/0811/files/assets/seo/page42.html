        <span class="">By Miranda Reiman </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">There’s Midwestern nice and Southern charm. NewYork has its bright city lights and there’s the West Coast sunshine. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Every region is known for something. When you dial down into the agriculture world, certain states or areas seem to have a strong-hold. Wisconsin and dairy go hand in hand. Then you have Florida oranges, Kansas wheat, Georgia peaches—and who could think about the great expanses of states like Texas and Montana without also thinking of cattle? </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Move outside the U.S. borders and you may not see as clear-ly what American cattle producers are connected with around the world. Luckily for the beef industry, but not just by chance, that im-age overwhelmingly has been built on quality. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">For the most part, global consumers hear U.S. beef and they think marbling, corn-fed, unique flavor. In a word: tasty. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">That’s a prestigious reputation to own. But there’s an old adage, “It takes years to build a reputation and seconds to destroy it.”  If you’re a Middle Eastern beef consumer, who has just paid a pretty penny (or whatever currency might be involved) for your American beef, that’s undoubtedly true. After all, there are extra costs for freight, inspections, and repackaging already built into that beef. It costs more across the ocean and through the Strait of Hor-muz than it does just raised down the local dirt road. So that foreign consumer has shelled out some big bucks for a special meal out or to entertain in style and it all comes down to those first few bites. Is it </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">moist? Tender? Tasty? </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">It better be, because it has to live up to that reputation. The U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF)—a trade group that represents all domestic red meat production—says it promotes American beef as the high-quality player. These folks build demand on the fact that the U.S. can consistently provide the best to five-star hotel and restaurant establishments. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">As cattlemen and women it’s your job to protect that reputa-tion—build on it, grow it.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">A family in South Korea or tourists in Barbados are probably not the first things you’re thinking about as you sit down to pencil out a new breeding or management strategy, but you have to remember that those very people are adding dollars to your bottom line.  Last year, USMEF estimated that exports added more than $153 per head to each animal. No matter what prices are doing in this often-low-margin business, you can’t afford to give that up. The good news is those international consumers aren’t really that different than a domestic beef eater. Sure, they might take a few more livers, tongues or short plates than any given U.S. market buys, but everybody wants the same thing: a good eating experience.  If you let that focus define your farm or ranch, you’ll be in good shape for keeping that reputation on solid footing.  </span>

        <span class="">“Ahead of the feeding curve” is a good place to be with the volatile markets and ever-changing dynamics in the cattle feeding business. It’s also the theme of this year’s Feeding Quality Forum, slated for August 23 in Omaha, Neb., andAugust 25 in Garden City, Kan. Cattlemen and women, educators and allied industry are invited to learn more about topics that will impact their livelihoods at the sixth annual event.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“Max has always been an early adopter of new ideas, a true in-novator,” Corah says. He helped set up some of the frst feed-out pro-grams and bull tests, and pioneered the win-win concept. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“He is a great believer in the differences in genetics, and the merit that attention to quality has for ranchers, feeders and ultimately the end consumer,” he says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The meetings are sponsored by Pfzer Animal Health, Land O’ Lakes Purina Mills, Feedlot magazine and CAB. </span>
