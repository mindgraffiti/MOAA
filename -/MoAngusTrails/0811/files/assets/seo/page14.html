        <span class="">Nothing better than looking at really nice cattle. Unless it’s look-ing at them while referencing some really deep individual data.   Every cow is good at something, but in a few cases, the only thing they’re good at is looking good. That’s why we need records, unless money is of no importance.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Records should confirm those mature-weight guesses and, fac-toring in average weaning weights, point out the most and least ef-ficient cows. Ear tag numbers should convey age at a glance, and the oldest cows have made us the most money. That’s unless, again, we manage as if money is not important and let them stay regardless of whether they wean a calf each year.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Deeper data just goes into more detail on economically relevant traits. It’s amazing what lies beneath the appearance and basics of weight and functionality.   </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Uniformity can make a big difference, often $300 or more be-tween calves at today’s prices, and we can learn a lot by comparing weights per day of age. The less uniform a calf crop, the more we give up lot-size premiums at auction. If we sell direct, every buyer knows the value differences only widen after weaning and he must bid conservatively on uneven calves.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">That puts a premium on cows with a record of steady to higher adjusted-weaning weight. It incentivizes tight breeding and calving seasons, too.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Maintaining excellent health is mostly management, but genet-ics may play a role as well. Those with records often debit a cow’s </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <span class="">total points when her calves repeatedly turn up sick or dead after weaning.    </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Of course, sire influence is a huge part of herd genetics. Sorting cows by sire and calves by sire group can point out which combina-tions work best and which pull the average down.  Ten years ago, studies showed at least a $1,500 value spread between yearling bulls that looked about the same and weighed the same, just based on prog-eny differences at weaning. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">That could be double today and taken another step, through fin-ishing and into the packinghouse cooler, it could double again. But wait, as they say on infomercials—there’s more: if we keep replace-ment heifers, those differences could double again.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The optimum bull, chosen by his on-target estimated progeny differences (EPDs), registry and appearance, is a foundation deci-sion. The unknown alternative bull can miss most progeny criteria, creating a downtrend in cowherd performance and quality.  Carcass data is a natural component of complete herd records, not just a maybe-someday luxury. Yes, the Choice-Select spread var-ies, but we have to aim higher than that to the more stable targets of premium Choice and Prime.  </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The most consistent, high-quality beef cow herds in this country have sorted carcass data by sire group and individual cows. They al-low for outside factors of weather and sickness, but do not keep sires or their daughters that produce below-average progeny carcasses. That’s why their calves, already off the charts that show averages, just keep getting better. They eagerly raise the bar because numbers show the way to more profit.    </span>
