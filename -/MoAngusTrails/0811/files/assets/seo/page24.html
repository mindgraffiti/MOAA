        <span class="">“That lets you deal with a much smaller diameter product and you can cut it easier.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The reduction provides advantages on the plate. It will allow restaurants to market ribeyes at 8 to 10 oz. rather than 12 oz. and will bring the thickness back to a range of 1 to 1.5 inches, he says. Previous industry trends were to maintain the entire ribeye with the cap muscle intact. But that made for an increasingly larger sur-face area, and half the thickness of the new cuts. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We’ve cut ribeye steaks from the center eye muscle to increase the thickness of the steak. That provides a higher quality eating expe-rience with more tenderness, juiciness and favor,” Polzer says. In cooking, a thin steak has less water retention capability than the thick cut, Houser says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“A thicker steak will retain juiciness better and it won’t be over cooked as easily,” he notes. “Obviously the product quality is going to be better than on a thin-cut item.” </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">Strip steaks got an overhaul, too, but it was a simple solution. “All we do is take the strip loin and literally cut it lengthwise in half,” Polzer says. “What you end up with would be two flet-size pieces that then are cut into flet of strip loins.” </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">Much like the reduced ribeye, the strip loin flet makes for smaller portion size while gaining thickness. Popular</span>

        <span class=""> brand options include medallions from the chateau for two and the split strip. </span>

      <p>
        <span class="">At frst, consumers wondered how to cook the small-but-thick cuts, Underly says: “A lot of them tended to burn the outside, and the inside was not cooked properly either.” NCBA and the Beef Checkoff found an answer by helping retailers teach consumers a skillet-to-oven process. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“You brown the flets on the outside and then stick the pan into the oven where they can fnish nice and slow for the right doneness,” she says. “We also created some grill methods such as for the petite roast.” </span>

        <span class="">Despite a few years in a tough economy, beef purchasing has remained steady. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">“We know Americans love to eat beef and they are fnding ways to continue to eat beef,” Amen says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">The new cuts do their part to help keep costs down. They can be marketed in smaller package sizes, so more consumers can buy beef. Partly because the new cuts avoid some seam fat, several have been endorsed with the American Heart Association’s heart-check mark. “That’s basically communicating to consumers that eating beef can be healthy for you,” Amen says. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="">While the BIG and BAM approaches are helping boost beef con-sumption by marketing new cuts, “demand response will drive how we further innovate the program,” he adds. “We’ll keep working to meet the needs of consumers by providing options and high-quality beef products.” </span>
